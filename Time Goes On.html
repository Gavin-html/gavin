    <br>For this piece I started with the vocals, I noticed that these vocals, which do not originally go together, tell a story.
    <br>I decided to put them together to create a sad story of the falling of a relationship, from before it started to fall apart
    <br>to after it was all over. I searched for a guitar that would reflect this rise and fall, which is when I landed on what I <br>have now. 
    this is what I used as a basline, and with the addition of drums and some timing changes to make it more <br>appealing, we are left
    with this final product.
