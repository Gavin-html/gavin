     <br>My second finished work. <br> It's called: <br> <b>Moonlight:</b><br>

     <br>After finding that missing piece that made my songs feel whole in the last song, I made sure to move it earlier
     <br>in the process. With most of my songs I start with something random, seeing how it feels, and depending on how 
     <br>that goes, I normally can start right away. I found something that clicked and then looked for vocals, this proved 
     <br>to be difficult. The vocals seemed to direct the flow of the song so I needed to find something that matched the 
     <br>original piece. Once I found what I was looking for it was easy to figure out where to go. Here I started to experiment 
     <br>with risers and pauses in my music for dramatic effect and to build suspence and listener retention.
