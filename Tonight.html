        <br>This is my first completed work. <br>It's called: <br> <b>Tonight:</b> <br>

        <br>This is when I really started to try to put together everything I had been learning. It took a lot of time
        <br>and a lot of renditions before I got to this point. I experimented with different effects and bpm, trying to
        <br> see what fits. I eventually landed on similar to what I have now, but something seemed to be missing. this
        <br> is when I finally started adding vocals to my music, and this is what made this a finished product unlike 
        <br>the rest.
